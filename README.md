# Good README Generator


## Description
This app uses node.js and npm Inquirer to mainstream the creation of your project's README.md file. This is done by prompting the user via the console on components such as the project title, contribution guidelines, licenses used etc. The app then takes those responses and pushes them into a formatted readme file.

## Installation
To use this application, install node.js. After installing node, and cloning the repo, open the terminal at the file location. In the terminal, type "npm init -y" and "npm install" this downloads any required node packages. If you have trouble, type in the terminal "npm install inquirer" to directly install inquirer, the main package used in this app.

## Usage
After installing all our packages, you should open the index.js file. Within init(), change  you can const fileName from 'test.md' to 'README.md'. Now simply type "node index.js" to run our index.js file. Following this, you should be prompted with the first question in the terminal. Using the terminal, complete all the prompts. Upon completion you should be notified in the console of success. Revise your readme.md file and save it.
